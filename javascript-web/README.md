# Ditto JS Web Quickstart App 🚀

This directory contains Ditto's quickstart app for in-browser web applications.
This app uses Vite along with Typescript and React, and shows how to include
the Ditto SDK in a client-side app running in the browser.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll first need to create an app in the [Ditto Portal][0]
with the "Online Playground" authentication type. You'll need to find your
AppID and Playground Token in order to use this quickstart.

[0]: https://portal.ditto.live

From the repo root, copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env`, and fill in the
fields with your AppID and Playground Token:

```
cp .sample.env .env
```

The `.env` file should look like this (with your fields filled in):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Copy this file from ".env.sample" to ".env", then fill in these values
# A Ditto AppID and Playground token can be obtained from https://portal.ditto.live
export DITTO_APP_ID=""
export DITTO_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN=""
```

Next, run the quickstart app with the following command:

```
yarn && yarn dev
```
