# Ditto Quickstart Apps 🚀

This repo contains apps for many of our supported programming languages to show
how Ditto works as quickly as possible.

## Obtaining your Ditto Identity

The Ditto SDK requires you to provide an identity for your application, which may be
generated using the [Ditto Portal](https://portal.ditto.live/). For the purposes of these
quickstart applications, we'll be using the "Online Playground" identity type.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Online Playground identity type is _not_ suitable for production use. It is intended
> only for development and testing purposes.

To obtain your Ditto identity and configure the quickstart apps with it, follow these steps:

1. Create a free account in the [Ditto Portal](https://portal.ditto.live/).
1. Create an app in the Ditto Portal.
1. Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env`.
   - in a terminal: `cp .env.sample .env`.
   - in a macOS Finder window, press `⇧⌘.` (SHIFT+CMD+period) to show hidden files.
1. Save your app ID and online playground token in the `.env` file.

Please see the app-specific README files for details on the tools necessary to
build and run them.
