## Building the Application

Assuming you have the prerequisites installed, you can build and run the app by following these steps:

1. Create an application at <https://portal.ditto.live/>.  Make note of the app ID and online playground token.
2. Copy the `.env.sample` file at the top level of the `quickstart` repo to `.env` and add your app ID and online playground token.
3. In a shell, navigate to the `quickstart/cpp/taskscpp` directory and run the command `make build` to build the C++ application.

## Running the Application

The application is named `taskscpp` and is located in the `quickstart/cpp/taskscpp/build` directory.

You can run the application and see the available command-line options from the
`quickstart/cpp/taskscpp` directory by running this command:

```sh
./build/taskscpp --help
```

If you run the application without any arguments, it will start running in a
terminal UI mode, displaying the available tasks in a list.  You can use these
keys to control the UI:

- Down arrow or `j`: Move down in the list
- Up arrow or `k`: Move up in the list
- `Space`, `Return`, or `Enter`: Toggle the completion status of the selected task
- `e`: Edit the title of the selected task
- `d`: Delete the selected task
- `c`: Create a new task
- `s`: Toggle Ditto synchrohnization on/off
- `q`: Quit the application

If you run the QuickStart Tasks app on other devices, the data will be synced
between them.
