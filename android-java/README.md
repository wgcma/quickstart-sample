# Ditto Android Java Quickstart App 🚀

## Dependencies

- A modern JDK installation
- Android Studio

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll first need to create an app in the [Ditto Portal] with the
"Online Playground" authentication type. You'll need to find your AppId and Playground Token
(at the top of the page) in order to use this quickstart.

In `app/src/main/java/com/example/dittotasks/MainActivity.java`, find the following variables:

```java
private String DITTO_APP_ID = "";
private String DITTO_PLAYGROUND_TOKEN = "";
```

Paste your own AppID and Playground Token into these variables, then click the Run button in
Android Studio to launch the app in an emulator.
